### Official ROS packages this Project requires: 

To get this project to work, import these packages and install them in the src directory of your catkin workspace. Be sure to clone the full GitHub directory and not just the package itself.

1. gmapping: With the gmapping_demo.launch file, you can easily perform SLAM and build a map of the environment with a robot equipped with laser range finder sensors or RGB-D cameras.
2. turtlebot_teleop: With the keyboard_teleop.launch file, you can manually control a robot using keyboard commands.
3. turtlebot_rviz_launchers: With the view_navigation.launch file, you can load a preconfigured rviz workspace. Youâ€™ll save a lot of time by launching this file, because it will automatically load the robot model, trajectories, and map for you.
4. turtlebot_gazebo: With the turtlebot_world.launch you can deploy a turtlebot in a gazebo environment by linking the world file to it.
